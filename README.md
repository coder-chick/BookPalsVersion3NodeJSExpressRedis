# Book Swapping Management System üìöü§ù

The **Book Swapping Management System** is a platform designed to connect book lovers within the same geographical region, making it easy to share and discover new reads. This system allows users to add, borrow, and rate books while fostering a sense of community among readers.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Book Owners**: Add books to share with others in your region.
- **Book Borrowers**: Browse and borrow books available locally.
- **Dual Roles**: Users can act as both book owners and borrowers.
- **Ratings**: Rate books on a 5-star scale after borrowing or lending them.
- **Advanced Search**: Search for books by title, author, genre, or rating (within your region).
- **Genres**: Books are categorized by genre for easy discovery.

## Technical Details ‚öôÔ∏è

### Core Functionalities
- **Geographical Regions**: Users are assigned to a specific region and can only borrow books within their area.
- **Loan Management**: Users can own and borrow multiple books, but a single book can only be loaned to one user at a time.
- **Data Consistency**: Borrowed and owned books are tracked to ensure availability.

### Data Management with Redis
We utilized a **Redis Hashmap** data structure to manage user data efficiently. Redis provides fast and scalable operations for creating, searching, updating, and deleting user records.

#### Example Redis Structure:
- **Key**: `user:<user_id>`
- **Fields and Values**:
  - `name`: User's name (e.g., "Jane Doe")
  - `region`: Assigned geographical region (e.g., "North Bay")
  - `borrowed_books`: List of borrowed books (e.g., `["Book1", "Book2"]`)
  - `owned_books`: List of owned books (e.g., `["Book3", "Book4"]`)
  - `ratings`: Dictionary of rated books (e.g., `{"Book1": 5, "Book2": 4}`)

### Search Capabilities
- Searchable fields include:
  - Book title
  - Author
  - Genre
  - Book rating
- Results are filtered by the user‚Äôs geographical region.

5. **Search**:
   - Users can search by title, author, genre, or rating within their region.
